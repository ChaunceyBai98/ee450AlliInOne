My code files are clientA.cpp clientB.cpp serverA.cpp serverB.cpp serverC.cpp serverM.cpp 
util/fileOperation.cpp util/stasInfo.cpp util/tcpHelper.cpp util/transferItem.cpp util/udpHelper.cpp.
clientA.cpp:Send tcp request to serverM based on parameters.
clientB.cpp:Send tcp request to serverM based on parameters.
serverA.cpp:Read and write files according to serverM's commands and send data to serverM.
serverB.cpp:Read and write files according to serverM's commands and send data to serverM.
serverC.cpp:Read and write files according to serverM's commands and send data to serverM.
serverM.cpp: Almost all of the business logic processing is in serverM.
util/fileOperation.cpp: Encapsulates the code for reading and writing files, making the main program code easy to read.
util/stasInfo.cpp: Defines the composition of statistical information.
util/tcpHelper.cpp: Encapsulates the code for getTcpSocket, bind and listen, making the main program code easy to read.
util/transferItem.cpp: Defines the composition of transaction information.
util/udpHelper.cpp: Encapsulates the code for getUdpSocket, bind and listen, making the main program code easy to read.
